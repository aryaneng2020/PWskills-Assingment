    "Ans 1. **Ridge Regression**:\n",
    "Ridge regression is a linear regression technique used to mitigate multicollinearity in datasets where the independent variables are highly correlated with each other. It extends ordinary least squares (OLS) regression by adding a penalty term to the OLS objective function, known as the L2 regularization term. This penalty term penalizes large coefficients, effectively shrinking them towards zero.\n",

    "The value of the tuning parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)) in Ridge regression controls the strength of regularization. The selection of \\(\\lambda\\) is typically done using cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, to find the value that minimizes the prediction error on a validation dataset. Grid search or other optimization techniques can also be used to search for the optimal value of \\(\\lambda\\) by testing a range of values.\n"

    "Ans 4. **Ridge Regression for Feature Selection**:\n",
    "Ridge regression can be used for feature selection indirectly by shrinking the coefficients of less important features towards zero. However, unlike Lasso regression, which can set coefficients exactly to zero, Ridge regression tends to shrink coefficients towards zero without eliminating them entirely. Therefore, Ridge regression does not perform explicit feature selection but can effectively reduce the impact of irrelevant or redundant features on the model.\n"

    "Ridge regression is particularly useful in the presence of multicollinearity, where the independent variables are highly correlated with each other. In such cases, ordinary least squares regression may produce unstable coefficient estimates with high variance. Ridge regression addresses multicollinearity by adding a penalty term to the objective function, which stabilizes the coefficient estimates and reduces their variance. As a result, Ridge regression tends to perform well in datasets with multicollinearity, leading to more reliable and interpretable models."

    "3. **Parameter Tuning**: Select the optimal value of the regularization parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)) using techniques such as cross-validation.\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the Ridge regression model on a validation dataset using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).\n",
