    "Probability Mass Function Definition\n",
    "Probability mass function can be defined as the probability that a discrete random variable will be exactly equal to some particular value. \n",
    "In other words, the probability mass function assigns a particular probability to every possible value of a discrete random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Mass Function Example\n",
    "Suppose a fair coin is tossed twice and the sample space is recorded as S = [HH, HT, TH, TT]. \n",
    "The probability of getting heads needs to be determined. Let X be the random variable that shows how many heads are obtained. \n",
    "X can take on the values 0, 1, 2. The probability that X will be equal to 1 is 0.5. \n",
    "Thus, it can be said that the probability mass function of X evaluated at 1 will be 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Density Function Definition\n",
    "Probability density function defines the density of the probability that a continuous random variable will lie within a particular range of values.\n",
    "To determine this probability,we integrate the probability density function between two specified points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Density Function Example\n",
    "Say we have a continuous random variable whose probability density function is given by f(x) = x + 2, when 0 < x ≤ 2.\n",
    "We want to find P(0.5 < X < 1). Then we integrate x + 2 within the limits 0.5 and 1. This gives us 1.375.\n",
    "Thus, the probability that the continuous random variable lies between 0.5 and 1 is 1.375.\n",

    "The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), of a real-valued random variable X, evaluated at x, is the probability \n",
    "function that X will take a value less than or equal to x. It is used to describe the probability distribution of random variables in a table. \n",
    "And with the help of these data, we can easily create a CDF plot in an excel sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple example for CDF which is given by rolling a fair six-sided die, where X is the random variable\n",

    "We know that the probability of getting an outcome by rolling a six-sided die is given as:\n",

    "Probability of getting 6 = P(X≤ 6 ) = 6 / 6 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, it is noted that the probability value always lies between 0 and 1 and it is non-decreasing and right continuous in nature.\n",
