    "Web Services Addressing (WS-Addressing) requires including routing information as metadata\n",
    "WS-ReliableMessaging standardizes error handling in SOAP messaging\n",

    "When you send a request to a SOAP API, you must wrap your HTTP request in a SOAP envelope. \n",

    "Due to the envelope, you can also send requests to SOAP web services with other transport protocols, \n",

    "Client-server architecture. The sender and receiver are independent of each other regarding technology, platforming, programming language, and so on.\n",
    "Layered. The server can have several intermediaries that work together to complete client requests, but they are invisible to the client.\n",
    "Uniform interface. The API returns data in a standard format that is complete and fully useable.\n",
