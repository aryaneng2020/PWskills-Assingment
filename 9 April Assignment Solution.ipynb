    "### Q1. What is Bayes' theorem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. It allows for the revision of existing predictions or theories in light of new evidence. Named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes, the theorem provides a way to calculate the probability of a hypothesis based on prior knowledge and new data.\n"

    "\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \\]\n",
    "\n",

    "- \\( P(A) \\) is the prior probability of event \\( A \\) (the initial probability of \\( A \\) before considering \\( B \\)).\n",

    "### Q4. What is the relationship between Bayes' theorem and conditional probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is fundamentally based on the concept of conditional probability. Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. Bayes' theorem uses conditional probabilities to update the probability of a hypothesis (event \\( A \\)) based on new evidence (event \\( B \\)).\n",

    "### Q5. How do you choose which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use for any given problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of Naive Bayes classifier depends on the nature of the data and the specific problem at hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Use this when the features (predictors) are continuous and are assumed to follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution. It's often used in applications like image recognition or medical data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Suitable for discrete data, especially when dealing with count data (e.g., word counts in text classification problems). Commonly used in natural language processing and text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**: Best for binary/Boolean features. It's particularly useful for text classification tasks where the presence or absence of a feature (e.g., a word in a document) is more informative than its frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose the appropriate Naive Bayes classifier, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Type**: Whether the features are continuous, count-based, or binary.\n",
    "- **Distribution Assumption**: Whether the data fits the assumptions of Gaussian, multinomial, or Bernoulli distributions.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Empirical performance on validation data. It can be beneficial to try different Naive Bayes classifiers and select the one that provides the best accuracy and performance metrics for your specific problem."
