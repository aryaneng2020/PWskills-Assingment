    "**Ans 1:** Lasso Regression, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function, known as the L1 regularization term. This penalty term penalizes the absolute values of the coefficients, encouraging sparse coefficient estimates by setting some coefficients to exactly zero. Lasso regression differs from other regression techniques, such as ordinary least squares regression and Ridge regression, in that it performs feature selection by automatically selecting a subset of relevant features while shrinking the coefficients towards zero.\n"

    "**Ans 2:** The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to automatically select a subset of relevant features by setting some coefficients to exactly zero. This leads to a simpler and more interpretable model by eliminating irrelevant or redundant features from the dataset. Lasso regression is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets with many features, as it helps to identify the most important predictors and reduce the complexity of the model.\n"

    "**Ans 3:** The interpretation of coefficients in Lasso Regression is similar to that of ordinary least squares regression. Each coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other variables constant. However, due to the L1 regularization term in Lasso regression, some coefficients may be exactly zero, indicating that the corresponding features have been excluded from the model. Therefore, the presence of non-zero coefficients indicates the importance of the corresponding features in predicting the dependent variable, while zero coefficients indicate that the corresponding features have been deemed irrelevant by the model.\n"

    "**Ans 4:** In Lasso Regression, the main tuning parameter that can be adjusted is the regularization parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)), also known as the penalty parameter. This parameter controls the strength of regularization applied to the coefficients. A higher value of \\(\\lambda\\) increases the penalty on the absolute values of the coefficients, leading to more coefficients being shrunk towards zero and potentially set to exactly zero. Conversely, a lower value of \\(\\lambda\\) reduces the penalty on the coefficients, allowing more coefficients to retain non-zero values. The choice of \\(\\lambda\\) affects the model's performance by balancing the trade-off between model complexity and predictive accuracy.\n"

    "**Ans 5:** Lasso Regression can be used for non-linear regression problems by incorporating non-linear transformations of the independent variables into the model. For example, you can include polynomial features or interaction terms in the dataset before fitting the Lasso regression model. These non-linear transformations allow Lasso regression to capture complex relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Additionally, techniques such as kernel methods can be applied to transform the feature space into a higher-dimensional space where linear separation is possible. However, it's essential to consider the interpretability and computational complexity of the model when using non-linear transformations with Lasso regression."
